# Text-to-Video retrieval with S3D MIL-NCE and OpenVINO

This tutorial based on [the TensorFlow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/text_to_video_retrieval_with_s3d_milnce) that demonstrates how to use the [S3D MIL-NCE](https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/mil-nce/s3d/1) model from TensorFlow Hub to do text-to-video retrieval to find the most similar videos for a given text query.

## Notebook contents
This tutorial consists of the following steps:
- Prerequisites
- The original inference
- Convert the model to OpenVINO IR
- Compiling models
- Inference

## Installation instructions
This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
